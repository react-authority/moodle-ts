# Changesets

This directory contains changesets for versioning.

When making changes that should be published:

1. Run `npx changeset` to create a new changeset
2. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
3. Describe your changes
4. Commit the changeset file

The release workflow will automatically create a release PR when changesets are present.
